# Getting Started

1. `clone` repository or download in `zip` format
2. run `cd project-name`
3. run `npm install`
4. run `npm run start` to start project with watch mode on
5. open `index.html` with any browser
6. change any file from `src` folder 
7. refresh `index.html` to see changes
8. run `npm run build` to build minimized assets for production

_Note: development server isn't included by default_

_I recommend to use `live-server` `visual-studio-code` extension with this template to achieve auto-refresh_
